      This site was built and is maintained by me, Travis Libby. I'm a web
      developer who likes to think of ideas and make useful things out of them
      for the web. This particular site was born out of the realization that I
      don't see nearly enough live music. The biggest problem is that whenever I
       see a long list of upcoming shows I haven't heard of most of the bands.
       With this application you can see who's playing, and get a small taste of
       what their music is like and the venue where they're performing.
